# macOS/Linux
PORT=8800 python app.py

# Or kill existing process
# On Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F

# On macOS/Linux:
lsof -i :8000
kill -9 <process_id>
```
```

You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 3. Install Dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "GROQ_API_KEY not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure .env file exists
ls -la .env  # On macOS/Linux
dir .env     # On Windows

# Make sure it contains your key
cat .env     # On macOS/Linux
type .env    # On Windows

# Restart application after adding key
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal, then run again:
python app.py
```

### Issue 2: "Module not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
# You should see (venv) in prompt

# Reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If specific package fails:
pip install package_name --upgrade
```

### Issue 3: Port 8000 already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use different port for this run
# Windows PowerShell
$env:PORT=8800; python app.py

# macOS/Linux
PORT=8800 python app.py

# Or kill existing process
# On Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F

# On macOS/Linux:
lsof -i :8000
kill -9 <process_id>
```

### Issue 4: File upload fails

**Solution:**
- Check file size (<200MB)
- Ensure file is CSV or Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
- Try sample data first
- Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)

### Issue 5: Query returns error

**Solution:**
- Ensure data is loaded (Step 1 complete)
- Rephrase query more specifically
- Check internet connection (LLM requires API call)
- Verify API key is valid
